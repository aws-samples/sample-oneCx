## In this module 2, you will build 
1. Agentic Wireless Billshock Support  
2. Agentic Wireline Network Technical Support

###### Important- Agentic Wireline Network Technical Support and Agentic Wireless Billshock Support are independent sub-modules hence you can run them in any order. However Agentic Self-Service is dependent on Agentic Wireline Network Technical Support and Agentic Wireless Billshock Support so make sure you complete them before you start to build Agentic Self-Service. 
###### Have fun!
