# BONUS Section

This module will guide you through the steps to create the following artifacts for the Workshop:

- An Amazon Bedrock Prompt Management Prompt to create a contact center transcript with input from the user describing the issue to resolve.
- An Amazon Bedrock Prompt Management Prompt to analyze the created contact center transcript to identify the issue(s), the action(s)taken by the agent to resolve, and the outcome(s) of the actions.
- An AWS Lambda function to process the analysis from the Prompt and post relevant journey events to the Connected Customer Journey solution.
- An Amazon Bedrock Prompt Flow to orchestrate the use of the Prompts and the AWS Lambda function.

At the end of the module, you will have built a fully working Amazon Bedrock Prompt Flow.
